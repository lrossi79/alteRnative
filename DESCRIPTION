Author: Luca Rossi 
Maintainer: Luca Rossi <lucr@itu.dk>
Description: AlteRnative uses OpenAI's APIs (for ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo and Dall-E) to create alternative version of social media content.Currenty the package has two main functions
   one for textual content that is designed to create alternative version of tweets that protect users' privacy while maintaining the meaning - thus the research value - of the textual content.
   The secon function creates "variations" of images that protect the privacy of anyon who is represented in the pictures while maintaining the meaning and the research value of the picture itself. 
   The package relies on openai to query openai's API thus it expects an API key stored as OPENAI_API_KEY in the Environment.
